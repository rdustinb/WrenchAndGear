## Launch Script
This script is used to parse the SpaceFlight Insider [Launch Calendar](http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/launch-schedule/) and properly format the event fields, writing them via the Google Calendar API to my Google Calendar. You can us it too, you just need to modify the script to point to YOUR Google Calendar API Instance and the calendars Public URL.

## .vimrc Configuration

My configuration uses either **Source Code Pro for Powerline** (MacOSX), or **Liberation Mono for Powerline** (Linux) for development.
